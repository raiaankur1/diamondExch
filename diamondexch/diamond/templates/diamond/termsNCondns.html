<h1> Terms and Conditions</h1>

Privacy Policy applies to thediamondexch.club as well as to all Diamond Exchange Group’s other brands, websites,
products or services. <br>
The aim of this policy is to give you better understanding of: <br>
<ul>
  <li> What personal information we collect
  </li>
  <li>Why we collect it and how we use it
  </li>
  <li>How this information is shared
  </li>
  <li> The rights you have to your personal data
  </li>
  <li>Other privacy and security information
  </li>
</ul>
Please note, you should read this notice in conjunction with our Terms and Conditions.<br>
References to “we” “our” and “Diamond Exchange” all refer to the Diamond Exchange Group and the relevant Data
Controller.
<h4>Applicable Legislation</h4>
Prior to the UK (and thus Govt)’s formal exit from the EU (“Brexit”), the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679
governed data protection law in Govt, from 25th May 2018 until 31st December 2020.<br>
This Regulation was superseded by the Govt GDPR following Brexit and the end of the Brexit transition period (ie as of
1st January 2021), by virtue of Section 6 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2019.<br>
Whilst largely the same, certainly in respect of the responsibilities it places on Data Controllers and Processors, as
well as the rights afforded to Subjects, it is important to note that it isn’t the EU GDPR that is in effect, and the
data protection law consists of both the Govt GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2004.<br>

<h4>Data Controller</h4>
The data controller for Diamond Exchange is Diamond Exchange (Govt) Ltd of Suite 741, Europort, Govt.
<h4>Your Personal Information</h4>
To register an account with us, you will need to provide some personal information. Examples of this may include, but
are not limited to; your name, email address, home address, telephone number, date of birth and debit/credit card data.
It is our primary concern that this data is kept safe and secure at all times, and our methods of ensuring this are
covered within this policy page. When we receive your registration information, your details will be processed, giving
you access to our online gambling services, full customer support, and deposit and withdrawal options.<br>
Additionally, as you start to enjoy using our Services, in order for us to provide you the gambling services contracted
for, or to comply with a legal obligation, or in our or your legitimate interest, we will collect other types of
information including: IP address and browser type; device information; your betting, gaming, payments and other account
transactions; chat transcripts, email correspondence and occasionally phone calls are recorded for training purposes;
social media details and other information derived from publicly available sources and third party sources – as
discussed below. We will also use the personal data we collect to personalise our offering to you and as part of our
risk management services, and will also use some personal data (email address and username only), to provide you with a
facility to share your customer experience via a trusted 3rd party platform, in furtherance of our legitimate interests.
We'll also use some of this information to tell you about our latest and/or personalized offers and promotions, and
notify you of any changes to our website or policies.<br>
<h4>Sharing and Processing your Personal Information</h4>
We may share your information with any other companies within our Group, which is defined as “internal” sharing – ie it
never leaves the Diamond Exchange infrastructure.<br>
An example of this is in the case of a self-exclusion, where it is necessary to apply this across all brands and
products operated by the Diamond Exchange Group. In such cases, the relevant data would need to be processed internally
to Diamond Exchange Group companies that operate other brands or websites.<br>
In order to provide you with the full gambling services you signed up to enjoy, your personal data will also be shared
with essential third-party service-providers, such as platform providers, game providers, payment-facilitation
processors, financial institutions, auditors and contractors.<br>
This sharing & processing may also be required in order to comply with a particular legal or regulatory obligation, for
example in relation to our legal obligation to properly identify and verify our customers, we may use 3rd party
electronic database providers such as credit reference agencies who allow us to verify customer information.<br>
We reserve the right to re-run 3rd party verification checks on customers who completed the registration process but did
not pass the verification check thus preventing them from using out Services, in an effort to assist such customers with
finishing the process to create a verified account, up to 6 months from the first registration attempt.<br>
In order to provide ease of access to the services contracted for customers making deposits using their credit or debit
cards, card details are stored and presented in a truncated format upon future repeat use.<br>
This information is your personal data and will only be used for the purpose described here. The information is stored
securely in accordance with Card Scheme Regulations and is not accessible by Diamond Exchange employees. Card Scheme
Regulations require us to inform you of the fact that we will store this information and, upon making your first
deposit, you will be notified of this processing. Should you continue with the transaction, you will be deemed to have
agreed to this processing.<br>
This type of processing also applies in relation to our compliance with Anti-Money Laundering or Safer Gambling
requirements, as well as crime prevention, detection or investigation of a crime or fraud. This processing also includes
referrals to regulatory or sporting integrity bodies.<br>
Your information will not be disclosed to government institutions or authorities unless:
We have your written consent OR,<br>
We are required to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal processes.<br>
<h4>Marketing Communications</h4>
Where we have the appropriate consent or lawful basis and subject to your preferences, some of your personal details
will be processed by our 3rd party marketing partners in order to allow us to communicate with all our customers either
by phone or email or push notifications (if you downloaded the app). This may include Email & SMS sending platform
providers, prize or gift suppliers, etc.<br>
The intention of these communications is to send you marketing material which we hope will be of interest to you – about
our promotions, new games, offers, prizes, events, etc. You will not receive marketing from third parties outside the
Diamond Exchange Group.<br>
Consent for this processing can be removed, in whole or in part, at any time, by contacting customer support and letting
us know what type of marketing communications you are happy – or not – to receive.<br>
All our marketing communications, whether by email or by SMS, will include instructions on how to opt out of receiving
this specific type of marketing communication. Please contact us directly using the above details, if you wish to remove
your consent for marketing activities completely and your personal details will be promptly removed from all of our
marketing processes. Please allow up to 48 hours following on from your request for this to be fully carried out.
We will not share your personal data with unrelated third parties to market their products to you without your prior
written consent.<br>

    you.

  <li>
    Right to Rectification of Personal data: You can request that we correct any personal data that we are processing

  <li>

    the
    right to be informed.</li>
  <li>
    Right to data portability: Similar to the right to access personal data, this right allows you to obtain your

    be
    relevant.</li>
  <li>
    Right to restrict / object to processing of personal data: in certain circumstances you have the right to object or
    restrict the processing of your personal data, where this processing is based on consent or our legitimate interest.

    legal obligations, we would be required to continue said processing.</li>
  <li>
    Rights relating to automated decision making and profiling: you have the right to not be subject to a decision which
    is based only on automated processing – ie without human involvement – where that decision has a legal impact or
    otherwise significantly affects you. We confirm that we do not make automated decisions of this nature.</li>
</ul>
As referred to above, you also have the general right to withdraw the consent you have given us to process your
personal
data (in respect of our marketing activities) and where this processing is based on what we deem to be our
legitimate
interest.
<h4>Cookies</h4>
We collect browser and cookie information when you first navigate to our websites. We use cookies to personalize
your
experience and for ease of your access. Some cookies will remember your username and password, or to remember your
language preferences, etc. Cookies also then record other pages visited and content viewed before and after you use
our
services. For users who opt in to have their personal data processed for marketing communications and promotional
information, this usage may extend to displaying selected advertising of Company promotions that will interest you,
either by device notifications or on social media pages. Please visit our Cookies Policy page for more information
about
cookies and how to manage the cookies we set, as well as third party cookies such as those used by your web browser.
<h4>Security</h4>
We take the security of your data and personal information very seriously, and have a number of measures in place to
keep you protected.
Robust security policies, rules, and technical measures have been implemented to safeguard all of your account
information. All employees, data-processors and third parties contracted by thediamondexch.club are legally required
to
abide by a confidentiality agreement.
In addition, we use RSA 2048-bit encryption technology and state-of-the-art security infrastructure to help ensure
that
your details are always safe and secure.
<h4>Retention</h4>
We retain all customer personal data and records for at least a period of 5 years post-account closure, in
compliance
with regulatory requirements and guidelines. We engage in periodic deletion of customer records where the account
has
been closed for more than 5 years. Should a current customer request a right to erasure, this would only be possible
5
years after the right to erasure request. Even after this period has elapsed, we would need to retain certain
information under legal obligation (for example, in relation to safer gambling and self-exclusion). We will take all
necessary steps to ensure that the privacy of your information is maintained for the periods of retention.
<h4>Data Protection</h4>
Your personal information may be processed in any country where we or our affiliates, suppliers, subsidiaries or
other
companies within our Group operate. By submitting your personal information to us, you consent to the use of that
information as set out in this Privacy Policy.
The data protection, privacy and other laws of countries outside the European Union countries may not be as
comprehensive as those of European Union-member countries. In these instances, we will take steps to ensure that a
similar level of protection is given to your information as is afforded the data of players within the European
Union.
<h4>Anti Money Laundering Obligations</h4>
Please note that as a licensed operator under both the Govt jurisdiction, we are legally obliged to comply with
local
and International Anti Money Laundering laws and regulations. These obligations require us to carry out certain
tasks
including but not limited to: screening for Politically Exposed Persons (‘PEPs'), Sanction List screening,
monitoring of
account activity to guard against potential money laundering risks, reporting of suspicious activity to the relevant
financial crime authorities, etc. It also means that we are required to retain all customer records for a minimum of
5
years after the relationship between the customer and us has ended. This information is retained securely and
confidentially at all times, where we comply with the highest standard of Information Security, being the ISO 27001
certification. Please contact Customer Support for more details.
Our Customer Support team are available 24/7 to answer any queries you may have regarding data protection and our
privacy policy, or to withdraw your consent you’re your personal data is being used by us to send you marketing
communications.
